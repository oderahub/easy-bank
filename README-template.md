## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size (responsive design).
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Interact with the footer, which features a logo change in color and a grid layout on larger screens.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity

### What I Learned

While working on this project, I learned the importance of **responsive design** and how to apply **CSS Grid** for layout. The challenge provided an opportunity to practice creating adaptive layouts using both **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** in tandem.

For example, creating a grid layout for the footer on larger screens was an exciting learning moment. Here's a code snippet for implementing the footer grid:

```css
footer {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  gap: 2rem;
}
Additionally, the process of adjusting hover states for interactive elements helped improve my understanding of user experience (UX) design.

Continued Development
In future projects, I would like to:

Improve my knowledge of CSS animations and transitions to make elements feel more dynamic.
Experiment more with JavaScript to add additional interactivity, such as form validation or dynamic content.
Explore different approaches to mobile-first design to ensure sites work optimally across all devices.
